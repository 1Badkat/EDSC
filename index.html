        <h2>Welcome to the Eganville & District Sportsman's Club</h2>
        <p>THE EGANVILLE & DISTRICT SPORTSMAN'S CLUB was established in 1978 to provide a conservation and shooting oriented organization in the Eganville area. In earlier years range space was rented from two different area farms, but in 1995, the club purchased 200 acres near the Bonnechere Caves and registered as a non-profit corporation. The club has now grown to about 200 members and has paid for the original land and the construction of excellent range facilities including a clubhouse. An adjoining 200 acres has also been purchased..</p>
        <p>Join us for events, training courses, and recreational activities throughout the year.</p>
