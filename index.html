        <h2>Welcome to the Eganville & District Sportsman's Club</h2>

        <p>THE EGANVILLE & DISTRICT SPORTSMAN'S CLUB was established in 1978 to provide a conservation and shooting oriented organization in the Eganville area. In earlier years range space was rented from two different area farms, but in 1995, the club purchased 200 acres near the Bonnechere Caves and registered as a non-profit corporation. The club has now grown to about 200 members and has paid for the original land and the construction of excellent range facilities including a clubhouse. An adjoining 200 acres has also been purchased..</p>
        <p>Join us for events, training courses, and recreational activities throughout the year

Located between the beautiful villages of Douglas and Eganville, near the Bonnechere Caves, the Eganville and District Sportsman's Club is known for many things. Aside from the picturesque property, with it's multitude of ranges, and large ponds, the club hosts many annual events. Some of these events range from an open house, to competitions, to the largest annual gun show in Ontario. Dedicated to supporting wildlife habitat enhancement programs, the primary focus is on the safe use of hunting gear in a practice setting, while protecting the surrounding environment.

Club membership affords access to the range, participation in club events and projects, and includes membership in the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters(OFAH). OFAH membership provides an annual subscription to the "Ontario Out of Doors Magazine" and $5,000,000 personal liability insurance.
